# MR-Cube Development Session Notes
**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Objective:** Build and deploy MR-Cube to Quest 3, resolve cube positioning, spinning, and passthrough issues

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Cube Positioning Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Cube spawning behind user (z: 0.5)
- **Solution:** Updated cube position to z: -2.0 in SampleScene.unity
- **Location:** `/Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`
- **Details:** Modified cube transform position from (0, 0, 0.5) to (0, 0, -2.0) to place cube in front of user

### 2. Scene File Corruption ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem:** Broken component reference (ID: 1028263561) preventing Unity Editor from loading
- **Error:** `Broken text PPtr in file(Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity). Local file identifier (1028263561) doesn't exist!`
- **Solution:** Removed broken component references from scene file
- **Impact:** Unity Editor can now open project successfully

### 3. VRBuildTools Compilation Errors ✅ FIXED
- **Problem:** Multiple C# syntax errors in build script
- **Issues Fixed:**
  - Changed from `static class` to regular `class VRBuildTools`
  - Fixed try-catch syntax errors 
  - Removed obsolete `PlayerSettings.virtualRealitySupported` API
  - Updated to use modern XR Plugin Management
- **Location:** `/Assets/Editor/VRBuildTools.cs`

### 4. Build System Issues ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Command-line builds failing with gradle template errors
- **Error:** `mainTemplate.gradle file is using the old android application format`
- **Workaround:** SimpleBuildScript.cs created as alternative build method
- **Status:** Unity Editor GUI builds recommended over command-line builds

## Key File Changes

### `/Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`
- Updated cube position: z: 0.5 → z: -2.0
- Increased cube scale: 0.1 → 0.2 for better visibility
- Fixed broken component reference (ID: 1028263561)
- Verified SpinCube component properly attached

### `/Assets/Editor/VRBuildTools.cs`
- Fixed class declaration (removed static)
- Updated VR configuration for Unity 6000.0.53f1
- Added proper error handling for XR Plugin Management
- Maintained backward compatibility where possible

### `/Assets/Scripts/SpinCube.cs`
- Confirmed proper namespace: `MRCube`
- Verified rotation logic: speedX/Y = 90 degrees/second
- GUID confirmed: `b08f63cc9fe4c4da3847e8534ec65e18`

## Build Environment

### Unity Configuration
- **Version:** Unity 6000.0.53f1
- **Platform:** Android (Quest 3)
- **API Level:** 24+ (OpenXR requirement)
- **Architecture:** ARM64
- **XR System:** OpenXR with Meta XR SDK

### Connected Device
- **Device:** Meta Quest 3
- **ID:** 2G0YC1ZF8B09YT
- **Connection:** ADB verified, USB debugging enabled

## Remaining Work

### Pending Tasks
1. **Build Deployment:** Complete APK build and installation to Quest 3
2. **Passthrough Testing:** Verify MR passthrough functionality is active
3. **Rotation Verification:** Confirm SpinCube component works in VR
4. **API Level Update:** Consider updating to API 32+ for full Meta compatibility

### Known Warnings (Non-blocking)
- Minimum Android API Level warning (currently 24, recommended 32+)
- Black splash screen warning for MR apps
- Gradle template format warnings

## Technical Notes

### Build Process
- **Recommended Method:** Unity Editor Build & Run (GUI)
- **Alternative:** SimpleBuildScript.cs for command-line builds
- **Output Path:** `Builds/Android/MR-Cube.apk`

### VR/MR Setup
- OpenXR Plugin Management configured
- Meta XR SDK v77.0.0 installed
- Passthrough support enabled via OVR packages
- Hand tracking and interaction systems configured

## Success Indicators

✅ Unity Editor opens project without errors  
✅ Scene loads with cube positioned correctly  
✅ Build scripts compile successfully  
✅ Quest 3 device connected and recognized  
⏳ Final build and deployment pending  
⏳ VR functionality testing pending  

## Commands for Final Build

```bash
# Unity Editor build (recommended)
open -a Unity /Users/joshuapatterson/Coding/MR-Cube

# Command-line alternative
/Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/6000.0.53f1/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity \
  -projectPath /Users/joshuapatterson/Coding/MR-Cube \
  -batchmode -quit \
  -executeMethod SimpleBuildScript.BuildAndroid
```

## Session Outcome
Successfully resolved critical blocking issues preventing Unity project loading and identified clear path forward for completing MR-Cube deployment to Quest 3.
